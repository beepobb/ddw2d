# Data Driven World 2D Website

# About this website
The website uses a data frame of countries and all of the features used in the model for 2021. When the user inputs the money that they spent in the past year and the country they are from, all the feature values from the data frame that corresponds to that country are fed into the prediction method of our model. The result is then used to divide the money spend to show the number of healthy meals they could have donated.
