We used a class for modularity and reusability, allowing us to easily use the model in different parts of the code and in other projects. Additionally, a class provides a layer of abstraction that allows users of the class to work with the model without understanding the internal workings and implementation details. Furthermore, because things like parameter values are stored in the instance itself, it is easy to experiment with models that have different configurations. Finally, using a class allows us to easily implement variations of the model using inheritance (as we will demonstrate later).\n",

    "1) Mean Square Error (MSE): it is the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. While MSE is useful for gradient descent as a cost function, it should be noted that MSE is extremely sensitive to outliers, as large deviations between predicted and actual values are made even larger when squared. Additionally, MSE does not provide any insight on the directionality of the deviation (i.e. whether the model underpredicts or overpredicts).\n",
    "2) Mean Absolute Error (MAE): the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. MAE is less sensitive to outliers than MSE as the deviations are not squared but also similarly does not provide insight on directionality.\n",
    "3) R2 coefficient of determination (not considered): a value *typically* between 0 and 1 that provides a measure of goodness of fit of the model as it is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model. An R2 value of 1 indicates that the model perfectly explains the variance while 0 means the model does not explain any of the variance. **However**, in the case where more than 1 feature is considered, it is possible for R2 to be a negative value if the model has a particularly terrible fit. Furthermore, R2 is not a useful measure when there is more than 1 feature, as its value will with more features (predictors). Hence, we will not be considering R2 when evaluating our model.\n",
    "4) **Adjusted** R2 coefficient of determination: the adjusted R2 coefficient is essentially the R2 coefficient except that it takes into account the number of features in the model. This makes it a more meaningful metric for evaluating our multiple linear regression model, in which there may be multiple features (and allows us to meaningfully compare models with different number of features). \n",

Its adjusted R2 coefficient is also significantly better. In our investigation on the hyperparameters, we have observed the following:\n",
    "- **alpha** (learning rate): In general, a good value is somewhere between 0.1 and 0.01. Using smaller values means that more iterations are needed to converge to the cost function minima and therefore training would require more time (which is a non-issue for our small-scale project). If the learning rate is too high (e.g. 1), it is possible for the cost to increase during training instead. This happens because the gradient descent step becomes too big and the parameter values overshoot past the minima, causing it to diverge from rather than converge to minima. As a future improvement to our model, learning rate scheduling can be implemented, in which the learning rate starts off large (for quicker convergence) but gets much smaller when the parameters are closer to the minima (to avoid divergence with exploding gradients).\n",
    "- **epochs**: in general, the higher the better - the more iterations of gradient descent, the lower the cost function gets. However, as can be seen in the cost function plot above, the rate at which the cost decreases diminishes significantly after a certain point and therefore there is a trade-off between time and accuracy.\n",
    "- **test_size**: if too much of the data set is allocated to the test set, there may be insufficient data for training, which may result in the model being unable to pick up on the general trends in the overall data. A small training set is inadequate in representing the complexity of the data and the model is more likely to overfit to the small training set. It is also more sensitive to noise. On the other hand, if the test size is too small, the evaluation metrics may not be as reliable there aren't enough predictions and the evaluation metric becomes too sensitive to the specific data points chosen for testing, resulting in more varied and less reliable estimations of model performance. We found a test_size value of around 0.5 to have a good balance between the two. "

    "#### Approach 3: Locally Weighted Regression\n",
    "Previously, we attempted to transform our features to have them fit linearly with the target. However, sometimes it is difficult to determine what transformations should be used. We attempt to sidestep this issue by using locally weighted regression instead. Locally weighted regression, also known as LOESS, is a non-parametric variation of multiple linear regression that has several benefits. Unlike normal multiple linear regression, LOESS makes no assumptions of global linearity and can flexibly capture non-linearity. LOESS is similar to normal linear regression except that instead of minimising mean square error, it instead minimises locally weighted mean square error. In short, training examples nearer to the point of prediction are weighted higher than those further away. This makes LOESS adaptive to local patterns and less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However, LOESS isn't without its issues. Finding an appropriate value for the bandwidth parameter, which affects the spread of the gaussian kernel (the weight), is both important (due to the impact it has on model performance) and challenging. Furthermore, LOESS is more computationally intensive in that it has to compute the optimal parameter values for every prediction (as we have to minimise locally weighted cost). \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For this project, we have implemented LOESS as a subclass of our MultipleLinearRegression class. This allows us to inherit previously defined methods while making certain changes for LOESS. The main difference is that LOESS does not have a training step because optimal parameter values are obtained for each prediction (and hence the model does not store parameter values). See the class documentation below for more details."

    "As seen above, our model has a fairly low mean square error and mean absolute error which means our model is decently accurate in its predictions. Meanwhile, the model's adjusted R2 coefficient is 0.56045, which suggests that it explains slightly more than half of the variance in the dependent variable (target).

The low data count also made our model particularly susceptible to high variability in performance due to the splitting of data. For example, the randomly chosen datapoints for the training set may not form a good representation of the overall population and may result in the model learning less than ideal parameter values. Again, this issue is mitigated with more data points. We also suspect that the poor results of the locally weighted regression model might be similarly due to this lack of data, as it performed much better with the housing dataset (which has a lot more values). \n",

    "2) More thorough data cleaning; remove outliers and noise (as multiple linear regression is particularly susceptible to noise due to using MSE as a cost function)\n",
    "3) Introduce regularization parameters to combat overfitting (especially if we introduce many polynomial features)\n",
    "4) More stringent feature selection: we chose our selection by looking at the r2 coefficient between a particular feature and the target, but never considered looking at the correlation between the target and transformed versions of the feature. We did not do this due to time constraints as there are many transformations that can be applied and many possible feature variables to look at."
